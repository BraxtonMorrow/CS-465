# CS-465
# Architecture

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**
Well to start with HTML is quite simple and not super complex can't do a whole lot with it. With Full-stack you have a much more dynamic web page, especially if you end up creating a single page application (SPA), which is quite fast and both coder and user friendly.
**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**
With NoSQL you have a much faster back-end which compliments the SPA quite well allowing for crazy speed and scalablility

# Functionality

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**
Well JSON cannot contain functions its just a "framework" if you will it sort of sets peramaters for how things should look and what data will be in them, the Javascript uses the JSON data to do things with it, i.e. authenticate a user which is defined as having an email and a password by our JSON data.

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**
This entire website was refactored code. We took a base horribly looking HTML website, and turned it into a full stack website that is capable of serving many customers at once on a single thread SPA.
# Testing

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**
Using Postman helped a lot here allowing me to test my API endpoints
# Reflection

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
I will be able to create websites from scratch at this point quite easily and can use what I've learned here as a frame work for other websites I create.
